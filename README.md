# distributed_systemd_start
This package provides a systemd autostart service to start ROS in a distributed environment. An additional config script is supplied which will help you to install the service.
This is a fork of Peter Rudolph's distributed_system_upstart 
https://github.com/sem23/distributed_system_upstart 
I exchanged upstart with systemd. Tested on Arch Linux. Maybe Run on 
newer Ubuntu(>16.04) too.
